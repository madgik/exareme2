In order to test the validity of the algorithms we need to test specific parts of the implementation. In brief:

Client Algorithm Testing:

Training Functionality: Ensure the algorithm correctly updates its parameters or state given a batch of data.

Prediction Functionality: Test the model’s ability to make predictions on new, unseen data.

Evaluation Functionality: Verify the algorithm can calculate correct metrics (like loss, accuracy, F1 score, etc.) on a validation set.

Server Algorithm Testing:

Model Aggregation: Test the server’s ability to correctly aggregate models or parameters from multiple clients.

Configuration Management: Ensure the server correctly sets up rounds and other configuration settings based on the learning task.

Integration Testing:

End-to-End Functionality: Validate the complete cycle from data distribution, client training, parameter updates, server aggregation, and evaluation across multiple rounds.

Robustness to Diverse Data: Test how the algorithm handles different kinds of data distributions across clients.



Following, there is an general example of how we would test any algorithm. Bear in mind, this is an example that it is value lies in it’s ability to guide the developer to create a similar example, using mostly the logic of the test, not the code. The purpose is to outline the major areas that should be tested in each algorithm to ascertain the algorithm wrote by the developer will yield the proper results, without retesting robust flower components. 

Test Client (Generic)

import pytest
import numpy as np
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator
from exareme2.algorithms.flower.generic_algorithm.client import GenericAlgorithmClient
from exareme2.algorithms.flower.utils import get_model_parameters, set_model_params

@pytest.fixture
def sample_data():
    X_train = np.random.randn(100, 10)
    y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=100)
    return X_train, y_train

def test_client_training(sample_data):
    X_train, y_train = sample_data
    model = BaseEstimator()  # Replace with actual model class
    client = GenericAlgorithmClient(model, X_train, y_train)
    
    parameters = client.get_parameters()
    new_parameters, num_examples, _ = client.fit(parameters, {})
    
    assert not np.array_equal(parameters, new_parameters), "Parameters should be updated after training"

def test_client_evaluation(sample_data):
    X_train, y_train = sample_data
    model = BaseEstimator()  # Replace with actual model class
    client = GenericAlgorithmClient(model, X_train, y_train)
    
    parameters = client.get_parameters()
    loss, num_examples, metrics = client.evaluate(parameters, {})
    
    assert loss >= 0, "Loss should be non-negative"
    assert "accuracy" in metrics, "Metrics should include accuracy"




Test Server (Generic)

import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator
from exareme2.algorithms.flower.generic_algorithm.server import get_evaluate_fn, configure_round

def test_server_aggregation():
    model = BaseEstimator()  # Replace with actual model class
    evaluate_fn = get_evaluate_fn(model)
    
    parameters = [np.zeros(10), np.zeros(1)]  # Mock parameters
    loss, metrics = evaluate_fn(1, parameters, {})
    
    assert loss >= 0, "Loss should be non-negative"
    assert "accuracy" in metrics, "Metrics should include accuracy"

def test_round_configuration():
    config = configure_round(1)
    assert isinstance(config, dict), "Configuration should be a dictionary"




Regarding the algorithm itself, we should have a general methodology to follow for every algorithm. This means that all testing algorithms should follow certain steps, if and when these steps apply to each individual algorithm.
