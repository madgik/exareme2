## Configuration with microk8s

The following packages need to be installed on **master/worker** nodes:

```
microk8s (sudo snap install micro8s --classic)
```

Additional configuration needed on the **master** node only:

```
microk8s enable dns ingress registry helm3
```

(Optional) You can enable the k8s dashboard with:

```
microk8s enable dashboard
```

### Hostname configuration

Currently, each node is distinguished from another one using their hostnames and they <b>MUST</b> be alphanumeric.
<br>If the node's hostname does not comply with that convention it has to be configured
from the kubelet following this [guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/#kubernetesiohostname).

To configure kubelet in microk8s you can do the following, quoting from https://microk8s.io/docs/troubleshooting:

```
To fix this you can change the hostname or use the --hostname-override argument
in kubeletâ€™s configuration in /var/snap/microk8s/current/args/kubelet.
```

## Cluster Management

### Add a worker node to the cluster

1. On the **master** node, get the join token with the following command:

```
microk8s add-node
```

Use the provided command, including `--worker` on the **worker** node to join the cluster.

2. Allow worker-specific pods to run on the **worker** node with:

```
microk8s kubectl label node <worker-node-name> nodeType=worker
```

3. If the node has status `Ready,SchedulingDisabled` run:

```
microk8s kubectl uncordon <node-name>
```

### Remove a worker node from the cluster

On the **master** node execute the following commands:

```
microk8s kubectl drain <node-name> --ignore-daemonsets
microk8s kubectl delete node <node-name>
```

On the **worker** node execute the following command:

```
microk8s leave
```
