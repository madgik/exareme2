### Prerequisites

1. Install [python3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "python3.10")

1. Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/ "poetry")
   It is important to install `poetry` in isolation, so follow the
   recommended installation method.

1. Install [poetry-shell-plugin](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry-plugin-shell/ "poetry-shell-plugin")

## Setup

#### Environment Setup

1. Install dependencies

   ```
   poetry install
   ```

1. Activate virtual environment

   ```
   poetry shell
   ```

1. *Optional* To install tab completion for `invoke` run (replacing `bash` with your shell)

   ```
   source <(poetry run inv --print-completion-script bash)
   ```

1. _Optional_ `pre-commit` is included in development dependencies. To install hooks

   ```
   pre-commit install
   ```

#### Local Deployment

1. Create a deployment configuration file `.deployment.toml` from the sample file:

   ```
   cp .deployment.sample.toml .deployment.toml
   ```

1. Create the config files that the worker services will use

   ```
   inv create-configs
   ```

1. Install dependencies, start the containers and then the services with

   ```
   inv deploy
   ```

1. Attach to some service's stdout/stderr with

   ```
   inv attach --controller
   ```

   or

   ```
   inv attach --worker <WORKER-NAME>
   ```

1. Restart a specific worker service with

   ```
   inv start-worker --localworker1
   ```

#### Execute an algorithm

- Examples
  ```
  ./run_algorithm -a pca -y leftamygdala lefthippocampus -d ppmi0 -m dementia:0.1
  ```
  ```
  ./run_algorithm -a pearson_correlation -y leftamygdala lefthippocampus -d ppmi0 -m dementia:0.1 -p alpha 0.95
  ```
